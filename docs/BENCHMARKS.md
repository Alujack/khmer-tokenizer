# Benchmarks

Running log of evaluation-harness results. Produced by `cargo xtask eval`
(see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) Phase 1). Corpus is khPOS `OPEN-TEST`
(1,000 sentences, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 — downloaded to `data/khpos`, never
committed; see [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) §3).

Metric definitions: token-span **P/R/F1** (SIGHAN convention — a predicted
token counts as correct only if both boundaries match gold), **R-iv** /
**R-oov** (recall restricted to gold words that are / aren't in the
tokenizer's dictionary), **word accuracy** (fraction of sentences segmented
with a fully correct token sequence).

## Reading Phase 1's baseline (~100-word seed dict)

- **R-iv ≈ 1.0**: the trie/longest-match mechanism itself is correct — when
  a word is actually in the dictionary, it's recovered almost perfectly.
- **Low P/F1**: the seed dictionary covers a small fraction of the corpus's
  vocabulary, so most words are out-of-vocabulary and fall back to
  single-cluster tokens, badly over-segmenting the output (many more
  predicted tokens than gold tokens, which drives precision down even
  though the words that *do* match are counted correctly).
- **R-oov ≈ 0.20**: about a fifth of OOV gold words happen to be a single
  KCC cluster already, so the naive fallback gets them right by luck.

## Reading Phase 2's lift (59,526-word dictionary)

Confirms `ROADMAP.md`'s framing — dictionary coverage was the biggest lever:

- **F1 0.2174 → 0.7216** and **word accuracy 0.5% → 36.5%** from swapping the
  dictionary alone; no algorithm change.
- **R-oov 0.2047 → 0.3505**: fewer gold words are truly out-of-vocabulary now,
  and the ones that remain are still sometimes matched right by luck.
- **R-iv 0.9990 → 0.8144 (a regression, expected):** with only ~100 words,
  every in-vocabulary hit was an easy, unambiguous word. With 59,526 words
  there's real longest-match ambiguity — greedy forward-max-match now
  sometimes swallows a dictionary word into a longer neighboring dictionary
  entry, picking the wrong boundary even though *a* dictionary word matched.
  This is exactly the greedy-FMM failure mode Phase 3 (BiMM / UnigramDp) is
  designed to fix, and it's now visible and measurable rather than masked by
  a tiny dictionary.

This sets up Phase 3 to be evaluated meaningfully: BiMM/UnigramDp's job is to
recover the R-iv/precision this larger dictionary gave up to ambiguity.

## Reading Phase 3's first result (BiMaxMatch vs. ForwardMaxMatch)

A small, real win, as expected for the "cheap intermediate" step:

- **F1 0.7216 → 0.7255**, **precision 0.7026 → 0.7072**, **R-iv 0.8144 →
  0.8184** — BiMM recovers a slice of the ambiguity FMM introduces, by
  picking the backward-max-match result on disagreement when it has fewer
  tokens (or fewer single-cluster tokens on a tie).
- **Word accuracy unchanged (0.3650 both ways):** BiMM only changes a small
  number of ambiguous spans per sentence; not enough sentences flipped from
  wrong to fully-correct (or vice versa) to move this coarser metric.
- **R-oov dipped very slightly (0.3505 → 0.3493):** BiMM's tie-break applies
  to the whole Khmer run, including runs that mix in-vocabulary and
  out-of-vocabulary clusters, so it can occasionally trade an OOV cluster's
  lucky fallback match for a better overall boundary.

## Reading Phase 3's second result (UnigramDp) — the bigger lever, confirmed

Frequency source: word counts from khPOS's `before-replace/train6.word` split
(12,000 sentences, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). **Computed and used locally by
`cargo xtask eval` only — never bundled, committed, or shipped** (see
`docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 and `ATTRIBUTION.md`). Before trusting this as a
fair comparison, confirmed by exact-line overlap that this training split is
effectively disjoint from `OPEN-TEST` (11/1000 incidental matches — the eval
set this table scores against) — it is, however, **100% contained in
`CLOSE-TEST`**, so `CLOSE-TEST` must never be used as an eval set alongside
these frequencies.

- **F1 0.7216/0.7255 → 0.7661**, beating both FMM and BiMM by a wide margin —
  confirms the roadmap's prediction that `UnigramDp` would be the bigger
  lever, not `BiMaxMatch`.
- **R-iv 0.8144/0.8184 → 0.8752**: real frequency data resolves a lot of the
  longest-match ambiguity that a 59,526-word dictionary introduces — far more
  than BiMM's structural tie-break could reach (BiMM can only choose between
  the forward and backward greedy paths; `UnigramDp`'s DAG can represent and
  score paths neither greedy walk can even produce).
- **R-oov flat (~0.35 across all three):** frequency scoring disambiguates
  between *competing dictionary matches* — it doesn't help clusters with zero
  dictionary matches at all, which is what R-oov measures. Expected; that's
  Phase 4's job (HMM/Viterbi fallback for OOV runs).

**Default strategy decision (`ROADMAP.md`'s open item #3):** `Strategy`'s
`#[default]` stays `ForwardMaxMatch`. Without a bundled frequency table (see
`with_frequencies`'s doc comment for why none ships), `UnigramDp` silently
falls back to `ForwardMaxMatch` anyway for anyone who doesn't supply their
own — so changing the nominal default wouldn't change any out-of-the-box
behavior. The real, actionable finding: **use `UnigramDp` with your own
frequency table whenever you have one** — it's the best of the three by a
clear margin.

## Reading Phase 4's result (HMM fallback for OOV runs)

Training data: BMES tag counts gathered from khPOS's `before-replace/train6.word`
split (same split, same disjointness/leakage caveat as `UnigramDp`'s
frequencies above — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 4 and `ATTRIBUTION.md`).
`with_hmm(...)` composes with any `Strategy`; it only re-segments maximal runs
of clusters that strategy matched *nothing* in the dictionary for at all —
every genuine dictionary hit (including real single-cluster words) is passed
through untouched. Measured on top of both the weakest and strongest Phase 3
strategy to see whether that holds:

- **R-oov 0.3505 → 0.4020 (FMM+HMM)** and **0.3499 → 0.4014 (UnigramDp+HMM)** —
  roughly a 5-point absolute (~15% relative) recall gain on exactly the
  words neither dictionary coverage nor frequency scoring could ever touch,
  confirming the roadmap's framing: R-oov was flat across all of Phase 3
  because none of those strategies do anything for clusters with zero
  dictionary matches — this is the first change that does.
- **R-iv exactly unchanged (0.8144 → 0.8144, 0.8752 → 0.8752):** the
  strategy-agnostic design — only ever touching runs of already-established
  dictionary-fallback single clusters — costs zero in-vocabulary accuracy in
  practice, not just in principle. This resolves the roadmap's "gate behind a
  strategy flag if it costs IV accuracy" condition: it doesn't cost anything
  measured here, so the existing opt-in (`with_hmm(...)` is `None` unless a
  caller attaches a model, exactly like `with_frequencies`) is gate enough —
  no additional `Strategy` variant needed.
- **F1 also improves** (0.7216 → 0.7358 FMM; 0.7661 → 0.7805 UnigramDp) and
  **word accuracy ticks up** (0.3650 → 0.3770; 0.3770 → 0.3900) — since R-oov
  recall gains flow straight into fewer over-segmented sentences, on top of
  whatever the base strategy already got right.
- **UnigramDp + HMM is the best configuration measured to date** (F1 0.7805,
  R-iv 0.8752, R-oov 0.4014) — the two Phase 3/4 levers (frequency-scored
  dictionary matches, statistically-guessed OOV runs) are complementary, not
  overlapping: one only ever operates where the dictionary matched something,
  the other only where it matched nothing.

## Reading Phase 5's result (orthographic normalization) — measured zero effect, root-caused

`core/src/normalize.rs` reorders a mark (shifter, vowel, or other sign) that
was typed directly before a `COENG`+consonant subscript pair to instead
follow it — the single most common real-world Khmer encoding error. This
isn't hypothetical: `grep`-ing khPOS's real `OPEN-TEST.word` file for the
pattern found **21 genuine occurrences** (e.g. `សិទិ្ធ`, a well-known typo
for `សិទ្ធិ` "rights"; `ស៊្រុន`, `ប៉្រាត`, `ប៉្រេម` — transliterated
personal names with a shifter typed before its subscript). Zero occurrences
of stray ZWJ/ZWNJ were found, so — since deleting characters would change
byte length and break the eval harness's span-based scoring without also
building an offset map back to the original text — that half of the
original Phase 4 roadmap item was descoped to just the reordering fix; see
`core/src/normalize.rs`'s module doc and `docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 5 for the
full reasoning.

- **Measured effect: exactly zero** — `ForwardMaxMatch` and
  `UnigramDp + HMM` score byte-for-byte identically with normalization on
  vs. off (both rows above match their `without_normalization()`
  counterparts to 4 decimal places).
- **Root cause, confirmed by directly cross-referencing all 21 corpus
  occurrences against `core/src/dict.txt`:** chamkho's dictionary already
  bundles the malformed spelling as a **separate, duplicate entry** right
  next to the canonical one for 12 of the 21 (e.g. both `កម្មសិទិ្ធ` *and*
  `កម្មសិទ្ធិ` are independent dictionary words) — so the plain trie match
  already succeeds without any normalization. The other 9 are personal
  names absent from the dictionary **in either spelling** (proper names
  aren't general-vocabulary words), so normalizing them doesn't create a
  match where none existed. Not one of the 21 flips from wrong to right —
  confirmed by re-implementing the same reorder rule directly against the
  corpus and dictionary in a standalone script, independent of the Rust
  eval harness.
- **This still meets the roadmap's exit criteria** ("a measured,
  non-negative effect"): zero is non-negative, and — more importantly — it
  confirms the pass carries **zero regression risk** on the corpus and
  dictionary this project ships. Kept on by default anyway, as defense in
  depth: the dictionary's duplicate-entry workaround is specific to the
  handful of words chamkho's maintainers happened to special-case, not a
  general fix. Any custom dictionary a caller supplies (`from_words`,
  `from_dict_str`), any word chamkho didn't special-case, and any future
  deduplication of `dict.txt` would all still benefit from normalizing the
  input rather than relying on that duplication.
